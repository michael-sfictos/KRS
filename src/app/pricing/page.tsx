    question: "Are the listed prices monthly fees?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The plan prices are monthly starting fees for ongoing accounting support. They exclude VAT and are confirmed once we understand your business structure, document volume, and reporting needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is included in the monthly price?",
    answer:
      "Each plan includes the recurring bookkeeping and compliance work shown in the comparison table. The exact mix of VAT, myDATA, annual filings, reporting, and advisor support depends on the plan you choose.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is payroll priced?",
    answer:
      "Payroll administration and ERGANI coordination start at €14 per employee per month. We confirm the final payroll scope before onboarding, especially when there are variable schedules or additional employment requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if my business grows or becomes more complex?",
    answer:
      "Your scope can grow with your business. If document volume, payroll, entities, or reporting needs change, your advisor will explain the revised scope and fee before any change takes effect.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are formation costs included when I am starting a company?",
    answer:
      "Formation support has a separate starting estimate, shown in the calculator. Notarial, legal, specialist tax, and other third-party requirements are scoped separately and confirmed in writing before work begins.",
